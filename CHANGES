[1.6]
- Lights soft shadow length is set to distance * 0.1 on creation.
- Added smooth lights, drop-in replacement for current lights. Better looking but with a performance cost. See DesktopBenchmark and TestApp

[1.5]
- Added ability render lights in frame buffer objects
- Fixed Shader compilation problems on ATI graphic cards
- Fixed ChainLight.update and .render access (now public as should)
- Changed Lights soft shadow length to distance * 0.1 on creation

[1.4]
- Build against LibGDX 1.6.2
- [API Change] Light.setContactFilter(...) is now not static and light specific, the static method for all lights is now called setGlobalContactFilter(...)
- [API Change] Deprecated the RayHandler.setCombinedMatrix(Matrix4) - use the setCombinedMatrix(OrthographicCamera) instead
- Added ability to resize the HayHandler's FBO (thanks to piotr-j)
- Added ability to set custom light shader for HayHandler (thanks to piotr-j)
- Added Light.setIgnoreAttachedBody(bool) to allow light ignore all the bodies fixtures attached to
- Added Light.getRayNum() method
- Added Light.remove(bool) method with conditional disposing, so that light could be removed/added to rayHandler without re-creation
- Fixed issue of box2dlights rendering incompatibility with ScreenUtils.getFrameBufferPixmap on some devices (issue #43)

[1.3]
- Added new ChainLight light type (thanks to sprucely) which which allows specifying a chain of vertices along one side of which rays are evenly distributed
- Added RayHandler.setCombinedMatrix(OrthographicCamera) method
- Added possibility to change the blending modes for basic, shadow and diffuse modes
- Changed the default diffuse blending to more realistic (without light overburn effect)
- Small improvement of performance for static lights updates
